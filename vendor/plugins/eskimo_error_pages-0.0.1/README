ESKIMO_ERRORS-0.0.1
===================

IMPORTANT - This code depends on the config.action_mailer.default_url_options[:host] being set correctly.

This plugin adds a few new pages (/error_pages/e404 and /error_pages/e500) which act as the frame for the error pages.

You need to add:
  after_save { ErrorPages.regenerate }
to any models which are used on the application layout.

This means that any time you save one of these object the 404.html and 500.html files are recreated.

If you want to have a custom 404 or 500 just create file in views/error_pages/e404 (or e500).  This code runs through the layout.
