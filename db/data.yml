      <p>It was when we first discovered Nkuku and their stunning fair trade bags that the penny finally dropped for us. We had already been blown away by the amazing cutting edge designs our upcycled brands like Alchemy Goods and Elvis &amp; Kresse were showing us, but we honestly didn&rsquo;t think we could find that same level of talent, design and craftsmanship if we went down the fair trade route. We couldn&rsquo;t have been more wrong if we&rsquo;d tried. If you think fair trade is only for people who wear socks with their sandals, then think again. Nkuku is well and truly cool.</p>
      <p>Based here in the UK, Nkuku is a family run business that has a unique and wonderfully refreshing approach to business. Not only are they committed to fair trade they are also eco-friendly and even advocate not buying something if you really don&rsquo;t need it.&nbsp; Not great for business but we can see their point &ndash; if you&rsquo;re going to buy, make sure your choice is a good one, in every way.</p>
      <p>Nkuku was set up by Ali and Alex after they spent a year travelling and working in Africa and India, meeting artisans, and witnessing their astounding skills but challenging living standards and restricted opportunities. Their objective became to promote and develop the traditional skills of these artisans and bring their work to the UK market. And the rest, as they say, is history!</p>
      <p>Nkuku&rsquo;s fair trade bags are inspired by the traditional skills of artisans in India &ndash; in fact many of their bags are handmade by just 40 families in Rajasthan. They combine contemporary designs with age-old techniques, natural materials and sustainable methods of production to ensure each bag is a truly unique work of art.</p>
      <p>Ali, Alex and the Nkuku team continue to make regular visits to India and have built up trusted and life-changing relationships with their suppliers and the artisans themselves, based on the principles of fair trade and equal opportunity. This means that everyone involved is paid a decent wage for their work, working conditions are safe and of a good standard and no children are exploited. They also work with as many natural dyes as possible, such as tree bark and vegetable extract &ndash; good for the environment and for the artisans too.</p>
      <p>Nkuku is now a fully fledged member of the World Fair Trade Organisation &ndash; a great achievement and one that clearly underlines their 100% commitment to fair trade. Perhaps Nkuku is the new Green and Blacks&hellip;</p>
      <p>And finally, if you&rsquo;re wondering about the name Nkuku, they&rsquo;ve borrowed it from a village in Zambia.</p>

      <p>For us, there will always be a special place in our hearts for Alchemy Goods. At the very start of our onfriday journey, we knew how exceptional these young upcycling designers were, however when we talked about our plans with friends and family you could just tell what they were thinking. Their eyes gave it away! The word &lsquo;bag&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t exactly a sexy word at the best of times. Add to that the word &rsquo;ethical&rsquo; and you can guarantee they were visualising their jute shopping bags shoved away in the car boot ready for the next Sainsbury&rsquo;s shop. We realised we had a bit of an image problem going on! Enter Alchemy Goods. We went everywhere armed with pictures of their upcycled bags. This is what it&rsquo;s all about, we would say, great cutting edge design and it&rsquo;s green too. It worked, people started to &lsquo;get it&rsquo;. Phew, we hadn&rsquo;t lost our marbles after all...</p>
      <p>People say that &ldquo;necessity is the mother of invention,&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s exactly how Seattle-based Alchemy Goods got started. Eli, founder of Ag, had his messenger bag stolen. Finding the perfect replacement however was proving to be impossible.&nbsp; Being a lad with a pad, there were always extra bike inner tubes lying around his apartment, so Eli set about building the perfect bag out of stuff he already had. The first prototype was born on his home sewing machine. It wasn&rsquo;t perfect, but it was exactly what he needed. It didn&rsquo;t take long before most of his friends wanted one too. Then local bike shops caught a glimpse and expressed interest. Each bag improved over the last. Word spread and demand grew and grew, which led to the founding of Alchemy Goods.</p>
      <p>While medieval alchemists sought to turn lead into gold, Alchemy Goods turn useless stuff like blown-out inner tubes and old seatbelts into useful stuff like bags. They source their inner tubes from Seattle bike shops. Each inner tube has distinctive details, like patches, logos and various textures, making each bag&rsquo;s exterior truly unique. The inner tubes are carefully checked for holes. Any blemishes that affect quality, such as punctures or glue, are removed. The tubes are then cut open, washed and stitched together, creating the bag&rsquo;s weatherproof shell. They develop a finish over time that gives them the soft feeling of fine Italian leather. And they&rsquo;re 100% waterproof and virtually stain proof too, so you can keep your stuff dry whatever the weather.</p>
      <p>They then scour local junkyards in search of car seatbelts. Each seatbelt is inspected for quality before being cleaned, splayed open and integrated in to your bag&rsquo;s design to form the strong, distinctive shoulder strap. These are way more comfortable than traditional messenger bag straps because they&rsquo;re wider and constructed of soft nylon material.</p>
      <p>Those of you with an eye for detail will have noticed the logos stitched to the bags have a small number in the upper right corner. This tiny number has big significance. It represents the percent (by weight) of upcycled material that goes into each product. They strive to make this number as high as possible by incorporating as much upcycled material as they can. You can show off this mark with pride!</p>
      <p>Each bag is assembled by hand in their Seattle workshop, a true work of art. So, we&rsquo;d like to thank whoever it was who stole Eli&rsquo;s bag &ndash; if it wasn&rsquo;t for you who knows whether we&rsquo;d still have our marbles.</p>

      <p>Just a few months ago, we&rsquo;d never sent an e-mail further than my little brother in Budapest. So, when we discovered some amazing bags made by a young design company out in Argentina, it didn&rsquo;t take us long to press the send button, signalling the start of our very first South American partnership. Soon, we were excitedly logging on to DHL each morning to watch as our parcel made its way across the Atlantic. At one point we did start to wonder whether the German customs people in Leipzig would ever chill out and get the parcel moving again, but eventually it found its way to us.</p>
      <p>4.50pm &ndash; 28 September - shipment picked up, Buenos Aires <br />8.50pm &ndash; 30 September - processed at DHL location, Madrid<br />2.30am &ndash; 1 October - clearance delay, Leipzig<br />10.07am &ndash; 8 October - clearance processing complete, East Midlands<br />8.11am &ndash; 9 October - arrived at DHL facility, Leeds<br />1.40pm &ndash; 11 October - shipment delivered, York</p>
      <p>After all that, thank goodness we were in!</p>
      <p>Wanting to find ways to help the environment brother and sister design duo Roberto and Debora Piwnica decided to start saving inner tubes of tyres and make them roll again, turning them into something they call daily design objects.</p>
      <p>When used rubber inner tubes from any kind of vehicle are discarded into landfill, it takes more than 500 years to decompose and if burned they are highly contaminating. In Argentina alone, around 100,000 tonnes of this stuff is disposed of each year. &ldquo;Recycling is a compromise with the planet&rdquo;, says Roberto, &ldquo;&hellip;and fashion has to do its part&rdquo;.</p>
      <p>So just three years ago, Neumatica starting doing some amazing things with rubber, transforming mountains of useless inner tubes into works of art and putting them back out onto the streets to start a second life. Working with inner tubes is certainly not straightforward. Sourced from all over Argentina, the inner tubes are put through a double cleaning process. Each pattern is then hand-cut, piece by piece and finally sealed with a special UV protection agent.</p>
      <p>All rubber inner tubes are plain when new and have no texture, but after being used, the heat of the tires transfers the design to them, giving unique, multiple textures to all of Neumatica&rsquo;s upcycled bags. Each finished piece has the story of many miles driven. No two bags will ever be the same, guaranteeing you&rsquo;ll be getting a unique, one-of-a-kind bag that will probably last you a lifetime!</p>

      <p>We just love working with NV London Calcutta!</p>
      <p>They seem to capture all that is elegant, chic and exciting about ethical fashion and are fast becoming one of the major players helping to bridge the gap between high fashion and traditional, ethical artisanship.</p>
      <p>Based in London, the driving force behind the emergence of NV London Calcutta is Naomi Cornelius-Reid. Voted the Future 100 Ethical Entrepreneur of the Year in 2009, Naomi is fundamentally committed to social change and she would like us all to join her revolution! NV London Calcutta combine the best of UK design talent with the promotion of age-old Indian craftsmanship and artisan skills, to produce entirely handmade, high quality fair trade bags and accessories.</p>
      <p>They work closely with a &lsquo;not for profit&rsquo; manufacturer based in Calcutta, West Bengal who is a&nbsp; founding member of the Indian Fair Trade Forum and also a member of IFAT, the World Fair Trade Organisation. This means that the people who produce NV&rsquo;s great bags all receive a fair wage and work in a healthy and happy environment.</p>
      <p>All materials are sourced locally in West Bengal and are of the highest possible quality, from butter soft buffalo hides, to rich hand-loomed silks.</p>
      <p>There is an amazing team spirit and working environment over in Calcutta &ndash; perhaps the annual company away week, where all 40 HQ employees travel to the coast to sing, dance and relax together, has something to do with it! Everyone is encouraged to learn new skills and develop their careers. In fact, anyone can use factory equipment out of hours to work on their own projects if they want to. Everyone is treated equally &ndash; one of the packing team is the only counter-signatory to the Managing Director. And in such a male dominated society, they have a woman in charge and apparently she&rsquo;s amazing!</p>
      <p>The manufacturer also partners with and supports over 26 grass roots producer groups, many rural based, providing an important source of income to the individuals and their families through the sale of their crafts whilst sustaining and nurturing their age-old artisan skills. It&rsquo;s a relatively small company and NV London Calcutta have got to know everyone on first name terms, including all the wonderful hand-picked artisan suppliers they partner with.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Our products are not only unique in design, but also, crucially, in the story behind them&rdquo; says Naomi, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t ask that you compromise your social or style standards. We wouldn&rsquo;t. We quite simply bring you an ethical alternative to the things you love and an opportunity for a brighter, more secure future to those who deserve it the most&rdquo;.</p>
      <p>Well said Naomi, we couldn&rsquo;t have put it any better ourselves!</p>

      <p>One of the really exciting things about our onfriday adventure is that we are starting to work with some incredibly talented and passionate young designers. Ethical fashion is still in its infancy, which means there are very few old hands or really big players in the business who dominate current thinking or determine future direction.</p>
      <p>Unlike much of mainstream fashion where the bottom line is often a top line priority and so much practice pushes both our moral and ethical boundaries, we are starting to discover a growing number of truly remarkable young people who are successfully combining cutting edge design with an genuine commitment to and deep understanding of the concept of ethical production and fair trade. <br /><br />Laura Queening is a perfect example of that. Having graduated from Cordwainers at the London College of Fashion in 2007, Laura established Aura Que a year later following the success of her graduate collection at the prestigious Drapers Award. So, with a passion for ethical fashion and her love of Nepal, Laura set about creating a production base in Kathmandu that would see her unique designs come to life.</p>
      <p>Her connection with Nepal started over six years ago when she taught English in a rural school in the south of the country for five months. Living with a local family, Laura soon became immersed in Nepalese culture, witnessing firsthand how the political situation had hit the country hard, stunting most development. So when Laura set up Aura Que, Nepal was a natural choice of country for the manufacture of her bags &ndash; a very practical and effective way of contributing to the country&rsquo;s regeneration.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>All Aura Que materials are sourced in Nepal and each design is brought to life in a Nepalese factory that employs local people, some affected by disabilities, providing an income and security for themselves and their families. Aura Que only work with manufacturers who are members of IFAT, the International Fair Trade Association, which means that working environments are healthy and safe and workers receive a fair wage. Laura is also keen to encourage trade directly with small Nepalese family businesses too, so she&rsquo;s working hard to build long term relationships with these skilled artisans based on the principles of fair trade.</p>
      <p>So, rest assured, our wonderful Aura Que fair trade bags are packed full of goodness! Each individually hand-crafted bag is created using the best natural materials and fibres Nepal has to offer. Every Aura Que bag has its own unique story to tell, inspiring and uplifting, which only adds to its charm!</p>

      <p>We have to admit, we stumbled upon Feuerwear purely by chance during one of our long and often fruitless Google searches. They must have remained just below our radar due to the fact they&rsquo;re based over in Germany and at the moment we can&rsquo;t find anyone here in the UK selling their bags. We&rsquo;re pleased our persistence finally paid off because the guys at Feuerwear are a bit special. Give them an old fire hose and watch them go&hellip;</p>
      <p>Every Feuerwear product is a one-of-a-kind piece that has its own individual story to tell. Every fire hose has seen years of active duty in the German fire service. They have been dragged through soot, grease and mud, in extreme heat and fire, and have transported thousands of cubic meters of water. By the time they get to the Feuewear team they have helped to save hundreds, if not thousands of lives.&nbsp; The reclaimed hoses can be either red or white and have a black rubber lining. Each hose is then scrubbed clean before being cut to size and handcrafted using high-quality materials. This requires a lot of skill and dexterity as well as some pretty sturdy machines capable of sewing such a tough material.&nbsp; Each hose bears the unique traces of its individual past meaning that every Feuerwear fire hose bag is unique in its colour and markings.</p>
      <p>Behind the Feuerwear label are brothers Martin and Robert Kl&uuml;sener. Martin is a textile engineer and responsible for design and production, whilst Robert heads up the marketing and distribution.</p>
      <p>The story started back in 2005 when Martin wrote his final year dissertation on the founding of a bag label and then promptly founded his own bag label.&nbsp; His goal was to recycle old, disused material and in doing so help the environment. After several attempts with jute bags and canvas sails, he began producing bags and accessories using recycled firefighting hose, working in the basement of his parents' house.</p>
      <p>Today Feuerwear has grown into a successful company committed to producing great products that have little or no negative impact on the environment. Their concept is based on their mission to recycle material and create green, eco friendly fashion. They are also big supporters of the modern lifestyle known to many as LOHAS (Lifestyle of Health and Sustainability). As a business they also off-set their transport carbon emissions and keep their production within Europe, working with small family-run organisations.</p>
      <p>Feuerwear products are now sold in more than 80 shops in 11 countries on 3 continents. And now, finally, their great fire hose bags are in the UK thanks to onfriday! Definitely worth all that searching.</p>

      <p>When you come across a design that almost takes your breath away you know it&rsquo;s going to be a good day! This happened to us when we saw the Anteos backpack made by a young eco design company called Cyclus over in Columbia. We&rsquo;d never seen anything quite like it before &ndash; for us it was an absolute must-have, so unique and a real design statement. The rest of their range didn&rsquo;t disappoint us either.</p>
      <p>Cyclus started life back in 2002 with just two people with a vision to reconnect with nature and the world. They believed that great design and imagination mixed with a good dose of down to earth common sense could start to change the way we think about the environment and how we interact with it. It was time to challenge age-old preconceptions around resource consumption and waste generation.&nbsp; So their journey began. Taking old vehicle tires and other reclaimed materials they started to redefine the whole design and production process, creating innovative upcycled bags that not only stood out from the crowd but were also robust, durable and very eco-friendly.</p>
      <p>Nature is an important source of inspiration for the designers at Cyclus. The Anteos backpack which first caught our eye is from their Pangolin range. A Pangolin is a mammal found in tropical regions of Africa and Asia and can look a bit like a walking pine cone or globe artichoke. It can curl up into a ball when threatened, with its overlapping scales acting as armour and its face tucked under its tail. Its name comes from the Malay word pengguling, which means &lsquo;something that rolls up&rsquo;. So their Pangolin range, including our very own Anteos backpack is based on the armour, the biomechanics and the movement of the Pangolin. This form of design is known as biomimicry, where science and art emulate nature&rsquo;s best ideas to solve human problems. The pangolin design is so new that it&rsquo;s still patent pending &ndash; bet you&rsquo;ve never had a bag that&rsquo;s patent pending before!</p>
      <p>Today, Cyclus has grown into a team of over 25 people and leads the way in eco fashion design in Columbia. In 2009 Cyclus was awarded the National Export Award for Small Business. They believe that eco development has an important role to play in Columbia&rsquo;s future growth and are supporting the idea of a national laboratory for eco design.</p>
      <p>As a company, they are committed to social justice and provide employment for some of Columbia&rsquo;s most disadvantaged communities, including displaced people and refugees, single mums and Indians of the Camentsa tribe.</p>
      <p>The best of eco design combined with a commitment to social justice &ndash; we like Cyclus a lot.</p>

      <p>It&rsquo;s now just over 50 years since the first three-point seatbelt was invented by Volvo's safety engineer Nils Bohlin. His invention has now gone on to save millions of lives worldwide however we wonder whether even the highly inventive and very talented Mr Bohlin could have predicted just how versatile the seatbelt would become.</p>
      <p>In the motor industry, miles upon miles of seatbelt material is produced each year. It must satisfy the highest of automotive standards before it can be used to make a car seatbelt. Unfortunately not all seatbelt material makes the grade so tonnes of it end up in landfill each year. It might not satisfy the stringent standards of the motor industry but it does meet the needs of Harvey&rsquo;s talented design team and their Treecycle range of seatbelt bags.</p>
      <p>It all began back in 1997, when husband and wife, Dana and Melanie Harvey, were installing seatbelts into their 1950&rsquo;s Buick. They hit upon an idea - why not use some of their spare seatbelt material and turn it into a bag. When friends and family saw the end result they all wanted one of their own.&nbsp; So Dana and Melanie decided to make a few more and then a few more &ndash; soon they were selling like hot cakes! Out of their small garage in California grew the very first seatbelt bag company and they haven&rsquo;t looked back since.</p>
      <p>Today, Harveys now lead the field in the design and manufacture of seatbelt bags and are based in a design studio in Santa Ana, California. They have an extensive range of seatbelt bags but there is one particular range that stands out for us &ndash; the Treecycle range. They take genuinely discarded seatbelts direct from the motor industry, weave them up and add some custom hemp lining to create a unique bag that is as eco-friendly as you can possibly get.</p>
      <p>No two Treecycle bags are the same so if you want a bag that&rsquo;s going to make you stand out from the crowd, it&rsquo;s got to be a Harveys seatbelt bag &ndash; the original and still the best!</p>

      <p>Trade Fairs, especially some of the really big ones, can be quite daunting experiences. The Autumn Fair at the Birmingham NEC was no exception. We&rsquo;d just set up our new company so this was going to be our first trade fair as a fully fledged buyer. It soon became apparent that the type of ethical bag you or I would be proud to wear was obviously in short supply. If I had been buying greetings cards I would have been in my element. But I wasn&rsquo;t. I was beginning to wonder whether this was going to be a big waste of my time when suddenly the vibrant colours of the Namaste stand caught my eye. And then I glimpsed their brand new range of suede bags - it was love at first sight. The trip had been worthwhile after all.</p>
      <p>Namaste, the company, was inspired by a journey through India in 1995 on reconditioned ex-Indian Army Enfield Bullet motorbikes. In search of some adventure, founder Sam Brummitt, his sister and her partner flew off to Kathmandu with a round the world ticket. After an inspirational trek to Mount Everest base camp in the wake of the worst storms for a generation, they travelled overland to India for a quick visit that turned into a six month adventure.</p>
      <p>Sleeping under the stars most nights by the side of the road they quickly developed a passion for this amazing sub-continent and especially the warm, friendly and hospitable people they met. One day in Rajasthan, they got into conversation with the owner of a small textile business who suggested they went back home to England and started a business. So they did and the rest, as they say, is history!</p>
      <p>Namaste is now a thriving business with a strong ethical policy at its core. They believe that the best way to reduce poverty is through trade. So they work with both primary producers and some larger organisations, harnessing the incredible skills and age-old techniques of local artisans. All of their products, including our wonderful suede bags, have been fairly traded which means as a minimum the workers all receive a fair wage that is at or above the national average and they work in an environment that is both safe and secure. Sam and his team go out to visit their suppliers several times a year and speak to them regularly which helps to ensure that all their suppliers meet internationally recognised fair trade standards. Namaste is recognised by BAFTS, the British Association of Fair Trade Shops as a fair trade importer.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>And finally if you&rsquo;re wondering why they chose the name Namaste for their business, it&rsquo;s after the greeting which was so often extended to them back in 1995. Some say it simply means &lsquo;Hello&rsquo; but a better translation, perhaps, is &lsquo;I greet the spirit within you&rsquo;.</p>

      <p>Oh my goodness me&hellip;or words to that effect, was our response when we opened up our first delivery of fire hose bags from James at Elvis &amp; Kresse. It was at that point, even with all the trials and tribulations of setting up the business, we realised life was good&hellip;really good! How could a fire hose become a thing of such amazing beauty?</p>
      <p>Elvis &amp; Kresse tick every box going. The coolest of brands, (ask Cameron Diaz and American Vogue), the best of cutting edge design and the greenest of credentials.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Elvis &amp; Kresse are constantly thinking about waste. The instant they met the London Fire Brigade back in 2007, they fell in love with their old hose. And they didn&rsquo;t stop there. They now collect fire hoses right across the UK, in fact 45 tonnes of it so far and counting.</p>
      <p>They scrub away all the soot, grease and everything else that builds up after 25 years of active duty and in the process reveal a truly remarkable, truly green textile.</p>
      <p>All of Elvis &amp; Kresse&rsquo;s products have the environment at their core &ndash; industrial waste is the cornerstone of their brand. Every product is made from reclaimed materials that were otherwise on their way to landfill. So, in addition to the genuine decommissioned fire hoses, they also use other textiles including old office furniture, scrap sail cloth and waste parachute silk to line their bags</p>
      <p>Their environmental philosophy permeates the whole business &ndash; all of their packaging is reclaimed or recycled too. Even the protective dust bag that your bag arrives in is made out of reclaimed parachute silk.</p>
      <p>And they are always on the look out for more waste, so if you know of anyone who has any spare hose (that&rsquo;s hose, not Os &ndash; you&rsquo;ll need to be over 40 to get that one!) then get in touch with us and we&rsquo;ll pass the message on.</p>
      <p>And just when you thought it couldn&rsquo;t get any better, by buying one of Elvis &amp; Kresse&rsquo;s fire hose bags, you&rsquo;ll be making a difference in lots of other ways too. They currently donate 50% of their profits to the Fire Fighters Charity and are supporting two coffee grower initiatives, one to build a spent domestic water filtration system at Jesus Maria in Nicaragua and the other to construct accommodation, kitchens and lavatories at Santa Ana La Huerta in Guatemala.</p>
      <p>So, would you agree? Life is good&hellip;really good.</p>

      <p>According to design guru Calvin Klein, hemp is going to become the choice of fibre in the fashion industry. In fact, the New York Times is saying even now that hemp is the height of fashion. So when we met Alf from Sativa and saw how passionate he was about his hemp bags we knew this was definitely worth further investigation.</p>
      <p>We didn&rsquo;t know much about hemp. Cannabis sprang to mind, but that was about it. So we started doing some research and soon realised what the fuss was all about. We think we&rsquo;re pretty down to earth at onfriday, not prone to over-the-top exaggeration but we do have our moments. And this is one of our moments. Hemp is truly remarkable and its green, eco credentials are quite literally second to none. Wow...</p>
      <p>Hemp is an annual herbaceous plant of the species Cannabis Sativa meaning 'useful hemp'. Imagine a plant growing in harmony with the earth, harvested by the sun, flourishing without the need of herbicide or pesticide and needing considerably less water than cotton to grow. As it grows it suppresses weeds, returning nutrients to the earth via its roots and fallen leaves. Every part of the plant can be used commercially, nothing goes to waste. Its core, fibres, flowers and seeds yield raw material for almost every conceivable human need. It grows to maturity in just 100 days and its long root system conditions the soil so it is an ideal crop to grow in rotation. See what we mean..?!</p>
      <p>So, combine hemp&rsquo;s sustainable, organic and eco-friendly credentials with great design and functionality and you get Sativa, a company that&rsquo;s simply buzzing with passion and enthusiasm and who believe that good living shouldn&rsquo;t cost the earth. Established in 2002, Sativa is based here in the UK and has a production centre over in China. They make regular visits to China and only work with suppliers and contractors who have developed an environmental policy, conduct their business in an environmentally responsible manner and who share Sativa&rsquo;s values on important issues like child labour, discrimination, working hours, freedom of association and health and safety.</p>
      <p>And if you&rsquo;re as curious as we were about how hemp differs from cannabis, here goes. <br />Cannabis has high levels of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in its flowers and leaves, a chemical, which is produced to protect its leaves from sunlight. Southern latitude strains such as those from India and Africa are high in THC whereas the northern latitude strains from Europe and Russia have a very low content. The low-THC strain (less than 0.3%) is known as hemp and the high-THC strain (more than 4.0%) is known as cannabis. The blanket ban on the cannabis plant back in 1937 in the US made no exception for hemp, as the two plants look virtually identical. However by the 1970s, scientists had been able to isolate THC which made it possible to prove beyond any doubt the difference between the hemp and cannabis strains. It&rsquo;s always good to have a few facts up your sleeve to impress your friends with!</p>

      <p>It&rsquo;s often tough getting back into the swing of things after a great holiday isn&rsquo;t it? We sit at our desks gazing out of the window wishing we could be transported back, thinking about our escape route. And that&rsquo;s usually as far as it goes - a dream that will never become a reality.</p>
      <p>In 2004, Emma Triplett was back at her desk after an amazing trekking holiday in Nepal. However, what makes Emma different from most of us is that she got up from her desk and decided enough was enough. She headed back to Nepal on a journey that was to change not only her life but the lives of many others, forever.</p>
      <p>Once over in Nepal, Emma got involved with a charity, the Esther Benjamins Trust and started teaching English at their new centre in Kathmandu. The centre looked after circus returnees who had been trafficked as children but were now coming of age and needed help and support reintegrating with their families and communities. Due to the stigma associated with being trafficked, they were often seen as an embarrassment and a burden to their families and treated as outcasts from society with no purpose and no future to look forward to. The centre gave the girls training in various skills with the aim of securing them a job so they could earn a living and become independent. However after just 3 months it become apparent that finding jobs for the girls just wasn&rsquo;t going to happen &ndash; no one was prepared to employ them.</p>
      <p>Having worked so closely with these girls, Emma couldn&rsquo;t bear to leave them with no sign of escaping the stigmatisation and poverty trap, so she approached the charity with the idea of forming an income generation project with them. The charity agreed to fund the training and equipment and Emma guaranteed to buy whatever they could make and take it back to England to sell. Emma and the girls haven&rsquo;t looked back since.</p>
      <p>In 2007, Hatti Productions was established in Nepal to formally take over the income generation scheme from the Esther Benjamins Trust &ndash; the transition from aid to a Fair Trade production centre had began. No one could have anticipated the unprecedented change that took place with the girls - they were no longer &lsquo;charity cases&rsquo;, rejected by society after a life trapped in brothels and bonded labour in circuses. They had become independent professional young women working for a foreign organisation. Finally they could leave their past behind and could hold their heads up high when asked where they were living and what they did. Their confidence went through the roof and their reintegration speeded up too. Their families started to visit, girls were invited to live with relatives locally and some even got married &ndash; the ultimate goal!</p>
      <p>The centre continues to thrive to this day. After a period of rehabilitation with the charity, the older girls (min age 17) are offered the opportunity to work at the production centre. They are provided with safe, secure accommodation with a house mother to care for them and are trained at the production centre. They are paid a good monthly wage, holiday, sickness, hospital fees and maternity pay and are helped to adjust to life.</p>
      <p>Many of our wonderful fair trade Hatti bags have been made by these amazing young women. Emma and her team, both here in England and over in Nepal are truly inspirational and we feel very honoured and really rather proud to be working with them. Thank you Emma!</p>

    - What happens to Undeliverable Gifts?

      <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It  has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it  over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at  Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure  Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through  the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the  undoubtable source.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>It  has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC</li>
      <li>Latin professor at  Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up</li>
      <li>In classical literature, discovered the  undoubtable source</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33  of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by  Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of  ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem  Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section  1.10.32.</p>

    - Why haven't I received my goods yet?
    - It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the  readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of  using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of  letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it  look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web  page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a  search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their  infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by  accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

      <p>Here at onfriday, life is an adventure and we&rsquo;re determined to live it adventurously. It&rsquo;s less about taking on the world and more about making the most of it. It&rsquo;s a glass half full way of thinking &ndash; an approach to life that is creative, full of exploration and discovery and has real meaning and purpose.</p>
      <p>It&rsquo;s also about belonging and being part of something. A coming home type of feeling that you get when something just feels right, when everything seems to fall into place and it all starts to make sense.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s like gazing into a beautiful azure sea and knowing you&rsquo;ve just got to jump in.</p>
      <p>And if you&rsquo;d like to be part of it, perhaps this onfriday adventure could start to make a difference too. We hope it will. With you on board who knows where we could end up? We don&rsquo;t like high horses or soap boxes and we&rsquo;re certainly not in-your-face ethical preacher people. All that stuff just turns us off. But we would like to see a more just and fair world. And a planet that has a future is very important to us too. We also happen to love great cutting edge design and really want to help young designers develop and grow. So it seems to be the perfect combination &ndash; an opportunity to showcase and support some of the most talented and exciting designers involved in ethical fashion today whilst helping to promote a fairer, greener world.</p>
      <p>So why not jump in and start your onfriday adventure with us today&hellip;</p>

      <p>We&rsquo;ve been asked many times why we plumped for bags! Finding and then getting to know our designers and suppliers has been a great experience and we&rsquo;ve been amazed and inspired by their passion, inventiveness and incredible design talent. But at the start of the journey, it was the story behind the bags that acted as our catalyst and these stories will continue to be at the heart of what we do. Finding, showcasing, selling and ultimately wearing bags that have either been upcycled or fairly traded gives us all a great opportunity to &lsquo;make a difference&rsquo;. Increasingly, we are all starting to think more about the effect our purchases have on the environment and the people who produce the things we buy. So we hope that through our onfriday bags we can help to raise awareness of some important ethical issues whilst providing some very real and tangible support to the people on the ground who are helping to make this world a fairer, greener one.</p>
      <p>We are members of &lsquo;1% For the Planet&rsquo;, a relatively new initiative that started over in the US but is now growing fast in Europe too. It encourages businesses, big and small to make a contribution, literally. Being a member means that each year 1% of our turnover is channelled into grassroots environmental projects around the world. We haven&rsquo;t decided yet which projects we&rsquo;ll be supporting &ndash; that&rsquo;s a deliberate decision on our part because we&rsquo;d like you to choose. By buying an onfriday bag you&rsquo;re increasing our turnover so it only seems fair that you make the decision! Over the next few months we&rsquo;ll be delving into this a bit more and will pull together a long list of potential projects. We&rsquo;ll then ask you what you think before we make a final decision. So, if you have any suggestions please get in touch!</p>
      <p>We&rsquo;ve tried really hard to ensure all of our packaging is eco-friendly too. We&rsquo;ve spent a fair few hours researching this and we&rsquo;re particularly chuffed to have found bubble wrap that is both recycled and recyclable! Our brown wrapping paper is both recycled and recyclable, the paper-based tape uses natural adhesive and can be recycled, the raffia is from sustainable sources and our tags are made of paper from sustainable sources too. Some of our designers and suppliers use surplus material, like reclaimed parachute silk to make their protective dust bags however other suppliers, particularly some of our fair trade ones, do use plastic to protect their bags during transit. We don&rsquo;t think this plastic is widely recyclable if at all, so you might want to check with your local recycling centre if you do decide to dispose of it.</p>
      <p>We&rsquo;re also very conscious that some of our bags travel many miles before they get to us &ndash; it&rsquo;s a concern for us and one that instinctively feels quite wrong and needs addressing. So, we&rsquo;re exploring ways of reducing our CO<sub>2</sub> emissions as much as possible and then offsetting the remaining unavoidable emissions by making a financial contribution to an environmental project. We&rsquo;re looking into a reforestation project in Kenya at the moment but we still have some work to do before making a final decision so we&rsquo;ll keep you posted!&nbsp; Please get in touch if you have any of your own suggestions or ideas, we&rsquo;d like to hear what you think. <br /><br /></p>

    - A just and fair world is something worth striving for, however big the barriers may be. A greener world is crucially important too. But knowing what to do, how to do it and ensuring it&rsquo;s a contribution that counts can be a real challenge. For us, trying to respond to this challenge is at the very heart of onfriday. We know we&rsquo;re far from perfect and have a long way to go, however we hope that what we are doing now, coupled with our plans for the future will help to make a difference &ndash; it might be a small contribution but hopefully it all counts.

      <h2>Accuracy of content</h2>
      <p>We will take all reasonable care to ensure that all details, descriptions and prices of products appearing on the website are correct at the time when the relevant information was entered onto the system.

However, as the actual colours you see will depend on your monitor, we cannot guarantee that your monitor's display of any colour will accurately reflect the colour of the product on delivery. Some of our products are made from reclaimed materials and therefore each bag will vary in terms of its colour and overall markings and therefore will not be identical to the product shown on the website.</p>

      <h3>How did you get started as a designer?</h3>
      <p>Prior to launching NV London Calcutta I spent 4 years as the Design Consultancy Manager at Bill Amberg, learning the A-Z of not only designing products but also all the other factors that go into producing a collection like costing, production and promotion. Designing is only the starting point of a range; it&rsquo;s often being able to turn the drawings in to a commercially viable offering that is the tricky part! You need to learn to be flexible and accommodating, especially in the ethical fashion world.</p>
      <h3>What projects are you currently involved in?</h3>
      <p>We have just launched our Back To Black Collection for Christmas which includes our gorgeous silk scarf collaboration with the very talented paper cut artist Rob Ryan and long awaited Men&rsquo;s Accessories Collection. Plus our specially commissioned Ayesha Make-up Purse for Cowshed&rsquo;s new Living Collection has just hit the stores, so we&rsquo;ve been busy bees!</p>
      <h3>What&rsquo;s going to be your next big thing?</h3>
      <p>We have a fantastic new classic bag range in the pipe line for next year. We are adding a new cooperative into the mix , that our workshop in Calcutta partners with, and are making use of their polished buffalo horn which is just beautiful. We are also developing a Home Collection, some new silks and have a couple of exciting new collaborative projects planned, though we can&rsquo;t say just yet who they are with - but we&rsquo;ll keep you posted!</p>
      <h3>Who has inspired you the most during your career to date?</h3>
      <p>My mum. She is a constant inspiration and a huge support. I have always looked up to and admired her. She created a very successful business from her passion in life and did it all as a single mother. She is a testament to never giving up on your dreams.</p>
      <h3>What gets you up on a morning?</h3>
      <p>Multiple cups of coffee and a loud alarm!! Unfortunately, I am not a morning person.&nbsp; I wish I was one of those people who find it easy to leap out of bed and spring into action but it&rsquo;s simply not the case, I am a complete night owl and am rarely at my desk before 9am. Once I am up and running though it&rsquo;s plain sailing. I absolutely love what I do and enjoy all the aspects of the business. The variety keeps me on my toes - there is certainly never a dull moment that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
      <h3>What advice would you give young designers struggling to get their first foot on the ladder?</h3>
      <p>Work experience is invaluable. Learn from those you admire. Be prepared to be flexible, be proactive, aim high and never give up. Never be afraid to ask questions. Never assume or keep quiet if you aren&rsquo;t quite clear about something. If it&rsquo;s difficult and off putting, that&rsquo;s probably what you need to tackle and overcome in order to make it work!</p>
      <h3>What does the future hold for ethical fashion?</h3>
      <p>I think the future is bright. The increase in high quality, well designed ethical product which can compete with the high street is on the up and I look forward to seeing more ethical fashion, not only online but also on our high streets. John Lewis are trail blazing with their People Tree concessions and I&rsquo;m sure it won&rsquo;t be too long before others follow in their footsteps. There are also fantastic initiatives bringing the best of boutique ethical fashion to consumers. I am heavily involved with Ethical Just Got Fabulous the first ever, bi annual, pop-up ethical department store. It&rsquo;s a unique shopping experience that combines a multitude of fashion focussed brands with live music and a host of other exciting add ons to give even the most jaded shopaholic a refreshing alterative to trawling the pavements! <a href="http://www.ethicaljustgotfabulous.com" target="_blank">www.ethicaljustgotfabulous.com</a></p>
      <h3>What&rsquo;s your favourite book?</h3>
      <p>That is a really tricky one to decide, I&rsquo;m a complete book worm, so it&rsquo;s almost impossible to narrow it down to just one! I read City of Joy by Dominique Lapierre recently, which was just brilliant. It&rsquo;s a true story about the slums of Calcutta, so I was completely hooked from the off and it has to be up there with the all time best reads. I&rsquo;d have to add A Fine Balance by Rohinton Mistry to the list too and A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseni. Both are just incredibly powerful stories which had a real effect on me.</p>
      <h3>What&rsquo;s your favourite film?</h3>
      <p>I don&rsquo;t really watch so many films but I absolutely loved The Lives of Others. It&rsquo;s an incredible story about East Germany, just before the fall of the Wall. I cried my eyes out and it was on my mind for days afterwards. On a lighter note, The Cohen Brother&rsquo;s The Big Lebowski has to be mentioned. I could watch it again and again, it&rsquo;s genius.</p>
      <h3>What&rsquo;s your favourite piece of music/song?</h3>
      <p>I think my favourite song of all time is &lsquo;So Good Today&rsquo; by a fairly little known singer called Ben Westbeech. It makes me happy no matter what my mood. Though I couldn&rsquo;t listen to just one song forever, so if I had to choose just one artist it would have to be Nina Simone. Her voice is phenomenal and has a song for every state of mind!</p>
      <h3>What would be your perfect weekend?</h3>
      <p>A long one! Preferably with my very wonderful and long suffering boyfriend, somewhere that has no internet or phone reception.&nbsp; Alternatively, a weekend away in the countryside with my friends or my family, cooking up a storm and going for long walks by the sea sounds like bliss.</p>
      <h3>If you were stranded on a desert island, what 3 things would you take with you?</h3>
      <p>A solar powered laptop, bikini and a bottle of red wine!</p>
      <h3>If you could meet anyone in the world (dead or alive) who would it be and what would you say to them?&nbsp;</h3>
      <p>Ghandi. I&rsquo;m not sure what I&rsquo;d say, I&rsquo;d just like to listen.</p>
      <h3>How would you describe yourself?</h3>
      <p>Determined, passionate and good with people.</p>
      <h3>How would your friends describe you?</h3>
      <p>Fun loving, enthusiastic, loyal and supportive.</p>
      <h3>How would you liked to be remembered?</h3>
      <p>As someone who gave it their all.</p>

    - |-
      <h2>&hellip;as an onfriday champion</h2>
      <p>We&rsquo;re going to develop this idea over the next few months, so watch this space. We&rsquo;re looking for a group of people who love great design, love bags, love ethical, love the onfriday way of thinking and love talking about it! Marketing guru Seth Godin would call you an early adopter who also sneezes! You&rsquo;re the type of person who is always in at the start, ahead of the curve and really passionate. And importantly, to be a sneezer, you also need to tell everyone (yes, everyone) about it. In return, we&rsquo;ll give you some great freebies and also offer you big discounts. So if you&rsquo;re interested please <a href="../../../page/contact-us">e-mail us</a>. If we&rsquo;re inundated (something tells us we might be) we&rsquo;ll need to think about some form of selection process &ndash; we&rsquo;ll keep you posted.</p>
    - |-
      <h2>&hellip;as an onfriday designer, craftsperson or supplier&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
      <p>We&rsquo;re always on the lookout for great designers and suppliers who share our philosophy however there will always be a limit to our searching capabilities. We have no doubt many will never appear on our radar however hard we try and that concerns us. So, please <a href="../../../page/contact-us">get in touch</a> if you would like us to stock and showcase your bags. You&rsquo;ll need to demonstrate your green and/or fair trade credentials through the materials you use, your production process and your supply chain. <a href="../../../page/contact-us">E-mail us</a> with your details and we&rsquo;ll get in touch.</p>
    - |-
      <h2>&hellip;if you work in a College or University</h2>
      <p>This is something for the future, but please do <a href="../../../page/contact-us">get in touch</a> now and tell us what you think. In a past life, we&rsquo;ve been involved in work-based projects, placements and final year dissertations and we&rsquo;re determined that onfriday plays its part in the nurturing of young talent. As we grow we would like to develop rewarding and meaningful partnerships with a number of colleges and universities and explore ways in which we can add value to your curriculum and the student learning experience.</p>
    - |-
      <h2>&hellip;if you&rsquo;re a student or recent graduate</h2>
      <p>Again, this is something for the future. Getting a foot in the door can be really difficult at the start of your career. Finding valuable and rewarding placements, work-based projects and internships can be tough. We know young talent will keep us fresh and on our toes so in the future we&rsquo;ll be working up some opportunities for you to get involved. We&rsquo;ll probably use <a href="http://www.facebook.com/onfridaybags" target="_blank">Facebook</a> to throw around some initial ideas so make sure you&rsquo;re part of our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/onfridaybags" target="_blank">Facebook</a> gang!</p>

      <p>Here at onfriday, life is an adventure and we&rsquo;re determined to live it adventurously. It&rsquo;s less about taking on the world and more about making the most of it. It&rsquo;s a glass half full way of thinking &ndash; an approach to life that is creative, full of exploration and discovery and has real meaning and purpose.</p>
      <p>It&rsquo;s also about belonging and being part of something. A coming home type of feeling that you get when something just feels right, when everything seems to fall into place and it all starts to make sense.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s like gazing into a beautiful azure sea and knowing you&rsquo;ve just got to jump in.</p>
      <p>And if you&rsquo;d like to be part of it, perhaps this onfriday adventure could start to make a difference too. We hope it will. With you on board who knows where we could end up? We don&rsquo;t like high horses or soap boxes and we&rsquo;re certainly not in-your-face ethical preacher people. All that stuff just turns us off. But we would like to see a more just and fair world. And a planet that has a future is very important to us too. We also happen to love great cutting edge design and really want to help young designers develop and grow. So it seems to be the perfect combination &ndash; an opportunity to showcase and support some of the most talented and exciting designers involved in ethical fashion today whilst helping to promote a fairer, greener world.</p>
      <p>So why not jump in and start your onfriday adventure with us today&hellip;</p>

      <p>Our wonderful Aura Que fair trade bags, designed by UK-based Laura Queening, are packed full of goodness! Each individually hand-crafted bag is created using the best natural materials and fibres Nepal has to offer. The banana yarn comes from the pruned excess outer layers of the banana tree after the fruit harvest. Each design is brought to life in a Nepalese factory that employs local people, providing an income and security for themselves and their families. Aura Que only work with manufacturers who are IFAT (Fair Trade) recognised, which means that working environments are healthy and safe and workers receive a fair wage.</p>

    - Buffalo Bag
    - Full of character, entirely handmade and strong enough to last you a lifetime, these amazing bags are made from buffalo hide by villagers high up in the Himalayan Kingdom of Nepal.
    - |-
      <ul>
      <li>Strong and robust tan-coloured buffalo      leather </li>
      <li>Traditional, centuries-old and      eco-friendly tanning methods have been used </li>
      <li>Two straps, long enough to fit      over the shoulder</li>
      <li>Leather toggle and hoop to keep      bag secure at the top&nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These bags are made in a small village in a remote area named Sidhukot, high up in the Himalayas. There are no phones or electricity, in fact no modern technology whatsoever. There is no work in the village and their subsistence farming doesn&rsquo;t provide enough food. So in order to work, they make a three-day trek to Kathmandu where they receive orders from Hatti for the buffalo bags and then return home to make them, collecting buffalo hide bit by bit as they go. These bags are currently responsible for the income and welfare of the whole community and contribute to many surrounding villages high up in the Himalayan mountains of Nepal.&nbsp;</p>

    - Really enjoyed last week's sneak preview. I honestly had no idea there were people out there turning useless things like inner tubes or fire hoses into such great bags. The stories behind the fairly traded bags are amazing too. I've got a real dilemma now - which one am I going to get!

    - Wow, I'm so impressed by these bags. I can see some that would be ideal for me. They'd make great presents too. I like how you've gone straight to the designers. And they're ethical too!
